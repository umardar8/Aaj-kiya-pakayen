# AAJ KIYA PAKAYEN?

I recently came across a problem which is common to many households in south asia when the wife, sister or mother asks you "Aaj kiya Pakayen?" meaning What should I cook today? So i thought to myself that it would be interesting if there was an app that randomly suggested names of local dishes along with their recipes for solving the daily cooking dilemma.
